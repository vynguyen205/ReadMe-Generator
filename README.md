## About 📋

A good and quality ReadMe is essential to any projects. A professional Readme needs to have components such as a description, how to use, a project preview, how to install, and letting others making contributions to your project. This command-line ReadMe generator will allow you to focus and spend more time on your project instead of getting distracted and worry about how to make a good ReadMe.
