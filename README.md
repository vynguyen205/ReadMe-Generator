## Usage Instructions 💻

Answer the questions prompted in the command line. Once you are done, the ReadMe will automatically be generated. Some parts of the ReadMe is left blank intentionally, so that you can manually input your own information in after the important parts of the ReadMe has been generated. Whichever part of the ReadMe that is not necessary to your project, please remove.
